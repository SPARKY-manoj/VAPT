# What is cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting internet-connected systems such as 
hardware, software and data from cyberthreats. It's used by individuals and 
enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other 
computerized systems. <br>
An effective cybersecurity strategy can provide a strong security 
posture against malicious attacks designed to access, alter, delete, destroy or 
extort an organization's or user's systems and sensitive data. Cybersecurity is 
also instrumental in preventing attacks designed to disable or disrupt a 
system's or device's operations.<br>
An ideal cybersecurity approach should have multiple layers of protection 
across any potential access point or attack surface. This includes a protective 
layer for data, software, hardware and connected networks. In addition, all 
employees within an organization who have access to any of 
these endpoints should be trained on the proper compliance and security 
processes. Organizations also use tools such as unified threat management 
systems as another layer of protection against threats. These tools can detect, 
isolate and remediate potential threats and notify users if additional action is 
needed.<br>
Cyberattacks can disrupt or 
various means, so creating a strong cybersecurity strategy is an integral part 
of any organization. Organizations should also have a disaster recovery 
plan in place so they can quickly recover in the event of a successful 
cyberattack.

## Why is cybersecurity important?
With the number of users, devices and programs in the modern enterprise 
increasing along with the amount of data -- much of which is sensitive or 
confidential -- cybersecurity is more important than ever. But the volume and 
sophistication of cyberattackers and attack techniques compound the problem 
even further.
Without a proper cybersecurity strategy in place -- and staff properly trained 
on security best practices -- malicious actors can bring an organization's 
operations to a screeching halt

# Domain Inside Cyber Security

### Network Security
Network security focuses on protecting the underlying infrastructure 
and components that make communication over the Internet possible. 
This includes safeguarding hardware like routers, switches, firewalls, 
and protocols like WiFi, Bluetooth, LTE, and VoIP. The main goal of 
network security is to prevent unauthorised access and misuse.
Critical aspects of network security include:<br>
* Firewalls – Hardware or software that monitors incoming and 
outgoing network traffic and blocks threats
* Intrusion detection systems (IDS) – Systems that identify 
suspicious activity or policy violations on a network
* Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) – Encrypted connections that 
allow remote users to access a private network over the 
Internet securely
* Access controls – Policies and procedures that restrict access 
to networks and resources only to authorised user

### Application Security
Application security involves identifying, fixing, and safeguarding 
vulnerabilities and weaknesses in software applications that attackers 
could exploit. This is crucial as applications are increasingly used to 
store and access sensitive data through the Internet.<br>
Critical aspects of application security include:
* Input validation – Ensuring all input to an application is valid 
before processing to prevent attacks like code injection or 
buffer overflow
* Authentication and access controls – Requiring login 
credentials and appropriate permissions to access 
applications and data
* Encryption – Encoding data at rest and in transit to protect 
confidentiality and data integrity
* Security testing – Systematically testing applications to 
uncover security flaws before deployment
* DevSecOps – Building security practices into every phase of 
the software development lifecycle

### Cloud Security
Cloud security addresses vulnerabilities unique to the cloud 
computing environment. As more data and applications migrate to the 
cloud, protecting these hosted services requires new approaches 
compared to traditional on-premise solutions.<br>
Critical aspects of cloud security include:
* Identity and access management – Providing appropriate 
access controls and minimising overexposed credentials
* Cloud encryption – Encrypting data while stored on cloud 
servers and in transit
* Visibility and analytics – Monitoring account activity and 
assets across cloud services
* Configuration audits – Checking for misconfigurations in 
complex cloud environments that could introduce 
vulnerabilities
* Vendor lock-in avoidance – Being able to migrate 
applications and data from one cloud provider to another

### Information Security
Information security focuses on preserving confidentiality, integrity, 
and digital data availability. This means ensuring that information is 
protected from unauthorised access, preventing improper 
modification, and ensuring accessibility for authorised users.<br>
Critical aspects include:
* Data loss prevention – Policies and technologies that stop 
users from sending sensitive data outside a system
* Data governance – The overall management of data assets 
and security controls
* Data classification – Categorising data by sensitivity levels 
and applying appropriate protections
* Disaster recovery and business continuity – Plans that allow 
restoration and continuity of systems and data after a 
security breach or disaster
* End-user education – Training all employees on cybersecurity 
best practices for handling company information
