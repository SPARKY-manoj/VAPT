# What is cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting internet-connected systems such as 
hardware, software and data from cyberthreats. It's used by individuals and 
enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other 
computerized systems. <br>
An effective cybersecurity strategy can provide a strong security 
posture against malicious attacks designed to access, alter, delete, destroy or 
extort an organization's or user's systems and sensitive data. Cybersecurity is 
also instrumental in preventing attacks designed to disable or disrupt a 
system's or device's operations.<br>
An ideal cybersecurity approach should have multiple layers of protection 
across any potential access point or attack surface. This includes a protective 
layer for data, software, hardware and connected networks. In addition, all 
employees within an organization who have access to any of 
these endpoints should be trained on the proper compliance and security 
processes. Organizations also use tools such as unified threat management 
systems as another layer of protection against threats. These tools can detect, 
isolate and remediate potential threats and notify users if additional action is 
needed.<br>
Cyberattacks can disrupt or 
various means, so creating a strong cybersecurity strategy is an integral part 
of any organization. Organizations should also have a disaster recovery 
plan in place so they can quickly recover in the event of a successful 
cyberattack.

## Why is cybersecurity important?
With the number of users, devices and programs in the modern enterprise 
increasing along with the amount of data -- much of which is sensitive or 
confidential -- cybersecurity is more important than ever. But the volume and 
sophistication of cyberattackers and attack techniques compound the problem 
even further.
Without a proper cybersecurity strategy in place -- and staff properly trained 
on security best practices -- malicious actors can bring an organization's 
operations to a screeching halt
